Generate tracked short links and QR codes for every WordPress post. Build a link-in-bio page and sell your WooCommerce products directly from Instagram, TikTok, or X.

== Description ==

Houla connects your WordPress site to [Hou.la](https://hou.la) and gives you four capabilities in a single plugin: **short links**, **QR codes**, a **link-in-bio page**, and **social commerce** through WooCommerce.

Every published post, page, or product automatically gets a tracked short URL and a downloadable QR code. Click and scan statistics appear right inside the WordPress editor. If you run a WooCommerce store, your products sync to a customizable bio page where visitors can browse, add to cart, and pay via Stripe - without leaving their social feed. Orders are pushed back to WooCommerce in real time with full stock management.

No separate e-commerce setup required. No third-party checkout to configure. Connect your Hou.la account, and the plugin handles everything from link creation to order fulfillment.

= Short Links =

* A short URL is generated the moment a post, page, or custom post type is published
* Replaces the native WordPress shortlink - themes and sharing tools use your Hou.la link automatically
* One-click copy and QR code preview in the editor sidebar
* Per-post click count and scan statistics accessible from the admin
* `[wphoula]` shortcode to embed short links or QR code images anywhere in your content
* Compatible with posts, pages, WooCommerce products, and any custom post type registered with `public => true`

= QR Codes =

* A QR code is created alongside every short link - no extra step
* Preview and download the QR code image directly from the post editor
* Customizable colors based on your Hou.la template settings
* Embed QR codes in your content with the `[wphoula qrcode=1]` shortcode
* Ideal for print materials: flyers, business cards, packaging, event posters

= Link in Bio =

* Build a professional bio page at hou.la/your-name with all your links in one place
* Showcase your WordPress blog posts, landing pages, and products on a single page
* Fully customizable: avatar, colors, layout, link order
* Integrated analytics: see which links your audience clicks the most
* Works for content creators, influencers, freelancers, agencies, and online stores

= Click Analytics and Statistics =

* Track clicks, scans, and referrers per link
* View statistics in the WordPress admin - no need to leave your dashboard
* Dashboard widget with total click count and a list of your top-performing links
* Short link column added to the Posts and Pages list for a quick overview
* Identify your best-performing content and channels at a glance

= Social Commerce with WooCommerce =

Turn your bio page into a storefront and sell from social media without building a separate online shop:

* **Real-time product sync** - products are pushed to your bio page when created, updated, or deleted in WooCommerce
* **Complete catalog data** - name, prices, sale prices, images, gallery, categories, tags, SKU, weight, dimensions, stock, variations, and attributes
* **One-click batch sync** - push your entire WooCommerce catalog to Hou.la
* **Category filtering** - choose which product categories to display on your bio page
* **Automatic order creation** - purchases made on the bio page generate WooCommerce orders with billing, shipping, and line items
* **Stock management** - inventory is decremented on sale and restocked on refund
* **Refund handling** - automated refund processing triggered by Hou.la webhooks

Payments are processed through Stripe on Hou.la. No payment gateway configuration on your WordPress site, no PCI scope, no credit card data stored locally.

= Who Is This For? =

* **Bloggers and content creators** looking for a URL shortener with real analytics and a bio page to group all their links
* **Small businesses** that want to sell products on social media without building or maintaining an online store
* **WooCommerce store owners** who want to reach customers directly through Instagram, TikTok, X, or any platform with a single link
* **Marketers** who need tracked short links and printable QR codes for campaigns, flyers, and packaging
* **Agencies** managing link analytics and social storefronts across multiple client sites from one workspace

= Setup in Under a Minute =

1. Install and activate the plugin
2. Go to **WooCommerce > Hou.la** and click **Connect to Hou.la**
3. Authorize in the popup
4. Done. Short links are generated on publish. Products sync when they change.

= Security =

* **OAuth 2.0 + PKCE** - industry-standard authentication, no client secrets stored on your server
* **AES-256-CBC** - access tokens and refresh tokens are encrypted at rest using your WordPress salts
* **HMAC-SHA256** - every incoming webhook is verified against a per-site shared secret
* **CSRF protection** - state parameter validation on the OAuth flow

= Developer Friendly =

Customize behavior with WordPress filters:

`add_filter( 'wphoula_allowed_post_types', function( $types ) {
    // Exclude pages from automatic shortlink generation
    return array_diff( $types, array( 'page' ) );
} );`

The plugin follows WordPress coding standards, uses the REST API for webhook endpoints, and stores all data in standard `wp_options` and `wp_postmeta` tables.

= External Service Disclosure =

This plugin connects to the [Hou.la](https://hou.la) API at `api.hou.la` to provide short link generation, QR code creation, product synchronization, and order processing.

**No data is transmitted until you explicitly connect your Hou.la account.** The connection requires your active consent through an OAuth authorization flow.

When connected, the plugin sends:

* Post permalinks and titles (to generate short links)
* WooCommerce product data including name, description, prices, images, categories, tags, SKU, weight, dimensions, stock, variations, and attributes (to sync products)

The plugin receives:

* Short link URLs and QR code URLs
* Order data from purchases made on Hou.la bio pages (to create WooCommerce orders)
* Click, scan, and commerce statistics

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin work without WooCommerce? =

Yes. Short links, QR codes, click statistics, and the link-in-bio page work on all public post types regardless of WooCommerce. The commerce features (product sync, order reception) require WooCommerce 7.0+.

= Do I need a paid Hou.la account? =

No. The free plan includes unlimited short links, QR codes, and bio pages. Commerce features are available on all plans. The difference between plans is the commission rate on sales: 8% on the free plan, 3% on Pro.

= How is this different from Linktree or other link-in-bio tools? =

Hou.la is integrated directly into WordPress. Your links and products are generated from your actual content - no manual copy-pasting. WooCommerce products sync automatically, and orders come back into your store. Other tools require you to manage links manually and have no connection to your catalog or order system.

= Can I sell products without a WooCommerce store? =

No. The social commerce feature requires WooCommerce because orders are created as WooCommerce orders. However, short links, QR codes, analytics, and the bio page work without WooCommerce.

= How are payments handled? =

All payment processing happens on Hou.la through Stripe Connect. No credit card data flows through your WordPress site. Completed orders are sent to WooCommerce via a signed webhook.

= What happens to my short links if I deactivate the plugin? =

Short links remain active on Hou.la. Only the local metadata in your WordPress database is removed when you uninstall. Reactivating and reconnecting restores the integration.

= Can I regenerate a short link for a post? =

Yes. Open the post in the editor and click **Regenerate** in the Hou.la metabox. A new link and QR code are created. The previous link continues to work.

= Which post types get short links? =

All post types registered with `public => true`: posts, pages, WooCommerce products, and any custom post type. Use the `wphoula_allowed_post_types` filter to include or exclude specific types.

= Can I customize the QR code colors? =

Yes. QR codes use the colors defined in your Hou.la template. Set your preferred foreground and background colors in the Hou.la dashboard and every generated QR code will match your brand.

= Does the webhook work behind a CDN or reverse proxy? =

Yes, as long as the `X-Houla-Signature` HTTP header is forwarded to WordPress. Cloudflare, Nginx, Apache, and most hosting providers forward custom headers by default.

= Is the plugin translation-ready? =

Yes. The plugin ships with a complete `.pot` file and a French translation (`.po` and `.mo`). You can translate it into any language using Poedit, Loco Translate, or the WordPress.org translation platform.

= Where is the data stored? =

Plugin settings are stored in `wp_options` under the key `wphoula-options`. Per-post data (short link URL, link ID, QR code URL) is stored in `wp_postmeta`. Product sync data (Hou.la product ID, sync status, sync date) is also in `wp_postmeta`. All data is removed on uninstall.

= Where can I get support? =

Open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MikhaelGerbet/wp-houla/issues) or email [hello@hou.la](mailto:hello@hou.la).
