## Overview

**WP-Houla** is a WordPress plugin that integrates your site with the [Hou.la](https://hou.la) marketing platform for short links, QR codes, and bio pages with built-in social commerce.

The plugin covers two primary use cases:

1. **Short links & QR codes** - every published post, page, or custom post type automatically receives a Hou.la short link and a QR code. The native WordPress shortlink (`get_shortlink()`) is replaced by the Hou.la link. Click statistics are available directly in the editor sidebar.

2. **Social commerce via WooCommerce** - your WooCommerce products are synchronized in real time with your Hou.la bio page. Orders placed by customers through Hou.la Pay (Stripe) are automatically created in WooCommerce with stock management and refund handling.

---

4. You are redirected automatically with a "Connected" status

---

## Usage

### Automatic Short Links

Once the plugin is connected:

- **On publish** - a short link is generated automatically when content is published.
- **Existing content** - the link is generated on first access or via the "Generate short link" button in the metabox.
- **WordPress shortlink** - `get_shortlink()` now returns the Hou.la link.

Links are stored in post meta and do not generate additional API calls after creation.

### QR Codes

Each short link generates a QR code visible in the editor metabox:

- **Preview** - QR code image in the sidebar
- **Download** - "Download QR" button
- **Embed** - `[wphoula qrcode=1]` shortcode in content

### [wphoula] Shortcode

| Example | Result |
|---------|--------|
| `[wphoula]` | Clickable short link for the current post |
| `[wphoula text="View"]` | Link with custom text |
| `[wphoula qrcode=1]` | QR code image (200x200) |
| `[wphoula post_id="42"]` | Short link for a specific post |

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `text` | Link text | Short link URL |
| `title` | Title attribute | Post title |
| `post_id` | Post ID | Current post |
| `qrcode` | Display QR code | `false` |
| `before` | HTML before the link | empty |
| `after` | HTML after the link | empty |

### WooCommerce Sync

Three modes:

1. **Automatic** - every create/update/delete pushes changes to Hou.la.
2. **Manual** - "Sync" and "Remove" buttons in the product metabox.
3. **Batch** - full catalog sync from settings (products processed in pages of 50).

**Synced data:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Name | Product name |
| Description | Short description (or full if empty) |
| URL | Permalink |
| Prices | Current, regular, sale |
| Currency | Site currency |
| Images | Featured image + gallery |
| Categories | Product categories |
| Tags | Product tags |
| SKU | Stock keeping unit |
| Weight | Product weight |
| Dimensions | Length, width, height |
| Stock | Quantity + status |
| Variations | Price, image, SKU, stock, attributes |
| Attributes | Visible attributes |

### Order Reception

When a customer purchases through your Hou.la bio page:

1. Stripe processes the payment via Hou.la Pay
2. Hou.la sends a webhook to your site
3. The plugin verifies the HMAC-SHA256 signature
4. A WooCommerce order is created (status "processing", method "Hou.la Pay (Stripe)")
5. Stock is decremented

On refund, an `order.refunded` webhook triggers WooCommerce refund with automatic restocking.

## Uninstallation

Deleting the plugin via the Plugins menu cleans up:

Short links on Hou.la remain active. Manage them from your Hou.la dashboard.

---

## FAQ

### Does the plugin work without WooCommerce?

WooCommerce is required for activation. Once activated, short links and QR codes work on all public post types regardless of commerce features.

### Is a paid account required?

No. The free plan provides all features. The only difference is the commission on sales: 8% (free) vs 3% (Pro). Short links and QR codes are free and unlimited.

### How are payments processed?

Payments are handled entirely by Hou.la via Stripe Connect. The WordPress plugin never touches payment data. Stripe ensures PCI DSS compliance.

### Do short links survive uninstallation?

Yes. Links on Hou.la remain active. Only the local WordPress metadata is removed.

### How do I regenerate a short link?

Click "Regenerate" in the Hou.la metabox. A new link is created; the previous one remains active.

### Do drafts get short links?

No. Links are generated only for published, scheduled, or private content.

### Can the batch sync be run multiple times?

A 10-minute lock prevents simultaneous syncs. Wait for the current sync to finish or for the lock to expire.

### Which content types support short links?

All public types: posts, pages, and any CPT with `public => true`. Customize with the `wphoula_allowed_post_types` filter.

### How do I customize supported content types?

```php
add_filter( 'wphoula_allowed_post_types', function( $types ) {
    // Remove pages
    $types = array_diff( $types, array( 'page' ) );
    return $types;
} );
```

### Do webhooks work behind Cloudflare / Nginx?

Yes, as long as the `X-Houla-Signature` header is forwarded. Most CDNs and reverse proxies do this by default.
